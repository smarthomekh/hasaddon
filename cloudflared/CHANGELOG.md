## What’s changed

## 🚨 Announcement
**This will be the last version to support armhf & i386 architecture.** 
All Home Assistant Community Add-ons are dropping or have already dropped support for armhf & i386, additionally it is expected that Home Assistant will drop support as well in the upcoming months.
Taking into account the very low number of downloads for those architectures, we will follow the general direction that HA and the Community Add-ons are going and drop support as well.
