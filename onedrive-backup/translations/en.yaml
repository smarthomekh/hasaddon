                This allows you to specify a list of paths for the addon to sync to OneDrive so you can for example sync your **Media** folder to OneDrive and exclude it from the Backups allowing you to save storage space (as this will only be stored once). Files are stored under a new directory called "FileSync" under the App Folder root. Source folder structure is maintained under this folder.
                Sync (sub)folders supported must be under one of the following roots: /config, /ssl, /share, /media, /addons
                You can specify an array of items here containing "path" and "recursive".
                See documentation for full usage details.
