## Deprecation warning

**This add-on is in a deprecated state!**

The Pi-hole add-on is now deprecated and will no longer be supported, maintained
and will not receive future updates or fixes.

Pi-hole used to be a great solution to filter network traffic, but it has been
a challenge to keep/get it in a working state as an add-on.

Meanwhile, the AdGuard team published an alternative:
[AdGuard Home](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-adguard-home).

AdGuard Home as surpassed Pi-hole in terms of capabilities, features,
and stability, and Home Assistant provides a good integration with AdGuard.
Above all, the AdGuard Home team has been supportive in developing the add-on.

For those reasons, it is no longer viable to keep maintaining the Pi-hole
add-on, which has been problematic at best.

We strongly recommend migrating to the AdGuard Home add-on, which is available
in the add-on store.

## About

[Pi-hole][pi-hole] is an advertising-aware DNS- and web server, meant to be run
on a dedicated Raspberry Pi connected to your home network. Pi-hole lets you
block advertisements for every device that connects to your network without the
need for any client-side software.

This add-on is a port of Pi-hole to be able to run on Home Assistant and
is based on Alpine Linux and is using Docker.
